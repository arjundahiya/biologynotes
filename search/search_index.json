Anti-diuretic hormone: Controls permeability of the kidney tubule If water level too low: More ADH released This makes the kidney tubule more permeable, so more water is reabsorped If water level too high: Less ADH released This makes the kidney tubule less permeable, so less water is reabsorped and more is lost as urine Kidney Failure Options for treatment: Kidney Transplant A donor kidney is surgically implanted to replace the failed kidney(s) Donor can be living as humans can survive with 1 kidney Advantage as one-time and patient can live a healthy life afterwards Disadvantage as organ may be rejected, patient has to take immunosupressants, infection Dialysis Patient is connected to a machine that filters blood Dialysis fluid contains correct concentrations of blood substances Dialysis fluid and blood run antiparallel to maintain conc gradient across part perm membrane Blood comes out of artery and returns through vein Peristaltic pump Air trap Advantage -
