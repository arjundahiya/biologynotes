## 4.5.3 Hormonal coordination in humans

### 4.5.3.1 Human endocrine system

**Endocrine** - Hormones released into the bloodstream by glands

**Exocrine** - Substance secreted from organs into other organs via ducts

| |Effect Received|Effect Duration|
|---|---|---|
|**Nervous System**|Quickly|Rapid|
|**Endocrine System**|Slowly|Longer|

**Glands in the Endocrine System**

|Gland|Location|Hormone Secreted|Purpose of Hormone|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pancreas|Abdomen|Insulin/glucagon|Control BG level|
|Thyroid|Neck|Thryoxine|Control metabolic rate|
|Pituitary Gland|Brain|ADH|Control water level|
| | |TSH|Control amount of thyroxine produced|
|Adrenal Gland|Above kidneys|Adrenaline|Initiate fight or flight response|
|Testes|Balls|Testosterone|Male sex hormone|
|Ovaries|Ovaries|Oestrogen|Female sex hormone|

**Pituitary Gland** - Master gland, secretes hormones in response to body conditions which act on other glands which produce homrones to cause effects

### 4.5.3.2 Control of blood glucose concentration

* BGC is monitored by the pancreas
* If it is too high:
	* Pancreas secretes *insulin*
	* Insulin causes cells to take in glucose
	* Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles
* If it is too low:
	* Pancrease secretes *glucagon*
	* Glucagon causes glycogen in the muscles and liver to be turned into glucose released into the bloodstream

**Diabetes**

* Diabetes is a disease where insulin either is not produced (type 1) or body cells do not respond to insulin (type 2) 

| |Type 1|Type 2|
|---|---|---|
|**Causes**|Pancreas can't produce insulin|Body cells become resistant due to insulin|
|**Treatment**|Insulin Injections|Diet and exercise|
|**Risk Factors**|N/A|Obesity|

#### 4.5.3.3 Maintaining water and nitrogen balance in the body

Ways water is lost in the body:

* (Excess in) Urinating
* Sweat from the skin (along with ions and urea)
* Lungs - exhalation

**Urea**

* Proteins are digested to produce amino acids
* These amino acids are deaminated in the liver, forming ammonia
* Ammonia is toxic to humans so is quickly converted into urea for safe excretion

**Kidneys**

* Blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries
* Blood is filtered, small molecules such as glucose, ions and water pass through
* These ions are then selectively reabsorped in the kidney tubule, molecules which aren't go down the ureter into the bladder as urine

**Control of water levels**

* Negative feedback
* Water is reabsorbed along the kidney tubules
* Permeability of the tubules can be changed using a hormone called *ADH*
* *ADH* - Anti-diuretic hormone: Controls permeability of the kidney tubule
* If water level too low:
	* More ADH released
	* This makes the kidney tubule more permeable, so more water is reabsorped
* If water level too high:
	* Less ADH released
	* This makes the kidney tubule less permeable, so less water is reabsorped and more is lost as urine

**Kidney Failure**

Options for treatment:

* Kidney Transplant
	* A donor kidney is surgically implanted to replace the failed kidney(s)
	* Donor can be living as humans can survive with 1 kidney
	* Advantage as one-time and patient can live a healthy life afterwards
	* Disadvantage as organ may be rejected, patient has to take immunosupressants, infection
* Dialysis
	* Patient is connected to a machine that filters blood
	* Dialysis fluid contains correct concentrations of blood substances
	* Dialysis fluid and blood run antiparallel to maintain conc gradient across part perm membrane
	* Blood comes out of artery and returns through vein
	* Peristaltic pump
	* Air trap
	* Advantage - keeps patient waiting for a transplant alive
	* Disadvantage - inconvenient as patient has to take time to go for appointments
