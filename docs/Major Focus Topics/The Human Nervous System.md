#### 4.5.2.4 - Control of Body Temperature

How is body temperature monitored?:
* Thermoregulatory centre in the brain monitors blood temperature
* Skin contains temperature receptors and sends impulses to TC

Methods of increasing temperature:
* Vasoconstriction - Blood vessels closer to skin narrow so blood - carrying heat - flows in deeper vessels further from the skin, reducing heat loss by radiation
* Hair stand on end - erector muscles contract and cause body hairs to stand up, trapping air and creating insulation for the body, reducing heat loss
* Shivering - Respiration for contraction of body muscles releases heat, increasing body temperature

Methods of decreasing temperature:
* Vasodilation - Blood vessels closer to the skin dilate, allowing blood - which carries heat - to flow through and increasing heat loss via radiation
* Sweating - Skin secretes water droplets which absorb heat from the body and evaporate, taking away the heat
