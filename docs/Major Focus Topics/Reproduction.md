## 4.6.1 Reproduction
#### 4.6.1.1 Sexual and asexual reproduction
* Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes (sperm/pollen + egg)
|Sexual reproduction|Asexual reproduction|
|--------------------|----------------------|
|Meiosis|Mitosis|
|Genetically Varied offspring|Genetically Identical offspring|
|Two parents required|One parent required|
* Sexual reproduction results in genetic variation as the gametes fused together come from different parents, resulting in a mix of chromosomes
* Opposite is true for asexual reproduction as the chromosomes only come from one parent so are all the same

#### 4.6.1.2 Meiosis
* Cells in reproductive organs divide by meiosis to form gametes (sperm/egg cells)
* Gametes have the haploid number of chromosomes (half of the original - diploid)
* The full number of chromosomes is restored during fertilisation when the gametes are fused

* Chromosomes in cell copy themselves
* Cell divides twice to form four gametes, each with half the number of chromosomes (1 set)
* Each gamete is genetically different

#### 4.6.1.4 DNA and the genome
