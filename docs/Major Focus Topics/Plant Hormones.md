## 4.5.4 Plant Hormones
#### 4.5.4.1 Control and Coordination

**Tropism** - Growth in response to stimuli

* A positive tropism is a growth in the direction of the stimuli
* A negative tropism is a growth away from the stimuli

**Types of tropisms**

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Phototropism| Growth in reponse to light|
|Geo/gravotropism|Growth in response to gravity|
|Hydrotropism|Growth in response to water|

**Plant Hormones**

|Name|Effect|
|------|------|
|Auxin|Causes cell elongation in shoots, inhibits growth in roots|
|Ethene|Causes fruit to ripen|
|Gibberelins|Ends seed dormancy, causes ripening|

**Phototropism**

* Auxin diffuses away from light
* This causes auxin to accumulate on the side away from the light in shoots
* Auxin results in cell elongation, so this side grows longer than the other side
* This causes the plant to curve and grow towards the light
* This is a *positive phototropism*

**Gravotropism**

* Due to gravity, auxin settles in the bottom of roots
* Auxin inhibits growth in roots
* This means the inside of the roots grow slower than the outside, so the roots turn downwards and grow towards water
